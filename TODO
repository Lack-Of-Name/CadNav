## Core Peer-to-Peer Architecture (Serverless)
- [x] Implement WebRTC P2P connections using Google STUN: `stun:stun.l.google.com:19302`
- [x] Create “Start Session” button → generates WebRTC offer (SDP)
- [x] Base64-encode offer → present as text + QR code
- [x] Create “Join Session” UI → paste or scan offer code
- [x] Generate WebRTC answer → Base64-encode → return to initiator
- [x] Establish encrypted P2P DataChannel
- [x] Auto-close connection when both peers close tab

## Location & Route sharing VIA WebRTC
- [x] Ability to recieve location and route from others live
- [x] Ability to disconnect
- [x] Ability to throttle update rate within range (1-60 seconds)

## Location Sharing (P2P)
- [x] Use `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition` for real-time location
- [x] Send `{lat, lng, accuracy, timestamp}` packets over DataChannel
- [x] Throttle updates to ~1 per x seconds (1 per 10 seconds)
- [x] Display connected peers and their routes on map in real time

## Offline Maps (Web App Compatible)
- [ ] Use MapLibre GL JS with vector tiles
- [ ] Implement offline tile caching via Service Worker + Cache API
- [ ] Allow selecting a region → pre-fetch `/z/x/y.pbf` tiles
- [ ] Store cached tiles in `IndexedDB` or Cache API
- [ ] Detect offline state → switch to cached map tiles
- [ ] Implement fallback if tile cache missing

## Upgraded Share System
- [ ] Add QR-based sharing for anything cross-device

## Secure Invite / Accept System (No Server)
- [ ] Use out-of-band sharing
- [ ] Require user-entered shared passphrase

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Ensure WebRTC connection works over LTE/WiFi
- [ ] Test offline map loading with airplane mode
- [ ] Test reconnect behavior when connection drops
